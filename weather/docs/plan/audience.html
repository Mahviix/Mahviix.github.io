The weather is important to have a knownlege of because this determines most of the actiities of the day, what types of cloths to wear, etc.People who actualy come online to check the internet for information about the weather are young and middle age adults, some teenages who are usually bothered about the weather conditions also do so. So my main targeted audience then ranges from ages 35 to 70.</p>
