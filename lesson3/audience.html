    <h2 class="topic">Targeted audience</h2>
    <p>My targeted audience for this website are indiduals who are curious about current weathers and weathers they should look forward to. The weather is important to have a knownlege of because this determines most of the actiities of the day, what types of cloths to wear, etc.People who actualy come online to check the internet for information about the weather are young and middle age adults, some teenages who are usually bothered about the weather conditions also do so. So my main targeted audience then ranges from ages 35 to 70.</p>

            <li>For a seminar a talk is to be given but immediately after the seminar, a showcase is to happen that is related to the seminar and is needed. A date has not been set but looking at weather predictions and information would help set the date, so outside would be alright to do the showcase.</li>
